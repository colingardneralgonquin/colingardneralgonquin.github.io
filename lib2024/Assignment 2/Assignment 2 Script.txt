		The Boeing corporation is most famous for its line of airliners like the 737.<br>
		Starting in 1916 Boeing has been prodicing aircraft for the civil and military sectors for over a century.<br>
		Boeing has acquired and merged with many other smaller companies over time, most notably Sikorsky, and Pratt & Whitney.<br>
		These two companies are major producers of helicopters and jet engines respectively<br>
		In the military sector, Boeing is called  Boeing Defense, Space & Security.<br>
		It produces military aircraft like the F-15E Strike Eagle and F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jets.<br>
		It also produces militarized versions of its airliners like the P-8 Poseidon and E-7 Wedgetail,<br>
		they also produce transports and tankers like the Globemaster III

		Boeing has found itself embroiled in a number of scandals over the past decade since its acquisition of McDonnel-Douglas.<br>
		It has been suffering from crashes, faulty construction, cost overruns, and delays.<br>
		Much of this has been due to a loss of capable leadership and talent in its workforce.<br>
		The new leadership largely lacks engineers, instead its is comprised of people better described as bean counters.<br>
		The loss of many older workers and inability to attract or retain professional talent has also taken a toll on the company's fortunes.<br>
